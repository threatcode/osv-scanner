## Configure OSV-Scanner

To configure scanning, place an osv-scanner.toml file in the scanned file's directory. To override this osv-scanner.toml file, pass the `--config=/path/to/config.toml` flag with the path to the configuration you want to apply instead.

Currently, there is only 1 option to configure:

### Ignore vulnerabilities by ID

To ignore a vulnerability, enter the ID under the `IgnoreVulns` key. Optionally, add an expiry date or reason.

#### Example

```toml
[[IgnoredVulns]]
id = "GO-2022-0968"
# ignoreUntil = 2022-11-09 # Optional exception expiry date
reason = "No ssh servers are connected to or hosted in Go lang"

[[IgnoredVulns]]
id = "GO-2022-1059"
# ignoreUntil = 2022-11-09 # Optional exception expiry date
reason = "No external http servers are written in Go lang."
```

Ignoring a vulnerability will also ignore vulnerabilities that are considered aliases of that vulnerability.
